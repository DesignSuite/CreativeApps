# DreamStudio - Design Suite Installer

Install the leading open source tools for creative design.  

## Mac OS

Copy the [Mac install script](MacOS/InstallCreativeApps.sh) and run in a local terminal.  

## Windows and Linux

1. Clone the 'CreativeApps' folder to your application folder.
2. Open terminal and cd to the folder.
3. Install dotnet on linux. (dotnet is already installed on PCs)
<pre>
curl -ssl https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash /dev/stdin --runtime dotnet --install-dir .
</pre>
Note: dot (.) after --install-dir denotes `Current directory`.

Since the script installs all the runtime into a single 'dotnetcore' directory, you can uninstall by simply deleting the folder.
